# Machine Learning Project: Prediction with Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a predictive problem. Using Python, the project walks through data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation of predictive models.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Model Implementation**: Training machine learning models, including linear regression and neural networks, from scratch.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and accuracy to evaluate model performance.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hazzanzz/Machine_Learning_Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Machine_Learning_Project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Machine_Learning_Project_1_Prediction_with_python.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step implementation to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Explore the data through visualizations.
   - Train machine learning models.
   - Evaluate their performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
